# My Personal Assistant Project

The goal of this is to provide a personal assistant able to help me accomplish every day tasks on my own computer.

It is meant to be local-first and will interact within a modern MacOS operating system on an M1 Mac laptop.

The main priority for now is:
- Have this store prompts for me on the terminal, which can then be pasted to my clipboard using `pbcopy` internally

## Prompt
A prompt is just a sequence of text.

## Requirements
I want to be able to list all the prompts and browse them page-by-page using the command line.

I also want to be able to search over the prompts I have using both semantic search and text-based search using something like BM25.
