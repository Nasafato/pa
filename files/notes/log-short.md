### Tuesday
Kettlebell/conditioning day
Morning
What's a runner's warmup? Maybe just the Gymnastic bodies warmup
2 laps around the park
[[Thoracic bridge]] series
- my wrists and elbows can't handle the table. Need to do this gradually
- reverse bear: pretty hard on the wrists
- Supine shoulder extension stretch: definitely can't tough fingertips together, definitely feel it in ulnar side of elbow
- Same with supine shoulder extension rocks
- Seal stretch: definitely feel it in lumbar spine, posterior pelvic tilt causes stretch in abs
- Reach underneaths: I don't get how to do these. Don't feel much of a stretch in the trapezius
- Seal rocks: click in right shoulder when exiting shoulder extension
- Plow pose: definitely need some help resting the legs above head, feel the stretch majorly in the neck and thoracic spine more than the traps
- thoracic band pull: these are hard as fuck. Even without band. Can't roll myself downwards.
- Prone thoracic extension with band: hard as well, hardest part is extending spine
- Elevated cap stretch: feel right shoulder more
- Capsule stretch: make sure to depress shoulders
- Handstand shoulder extension stretch: need to film myself
- Elevated bridge work: I am going to refrain from this for now

I need to figure out the warmup for the thoracic series.
