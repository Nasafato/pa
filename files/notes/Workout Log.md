### Tuesday
Kettlebell/conditioning day
Morning
What's a runner's warmup? Maybe just the Gymnastic bodies warmup
2 laps around the park
[[Thoracic bridge]] series
- my wrists and elbows can't handle the table. Need to do this gradually
- reverse bear: pretty hard on the wrists
- Supine shoulder extension stretch: definitely can't tough fingertips together, definitely feel it in ulnar side of elbow
- Same with supine shoulder extension rocks
- Seal stretch: definitely feel it in lumbar spine, posterior pelvic tilt causes stretch in abs
- Reach underneaths: I don't get how to do these. Don't feel much of a stretch in the trapezius
- Seal rocks: click in right shoulder when exiting shoulder extension
- Plow pose: definitely need some help resting the legs above head, feel the stretch majorly in the neck and thoracic spine more than the traps
- thoracic band pull: these are hard as fuck. Even without band. Can't roll myself downwards.
- Prone thoracic extension with band: hard as well, hardest part is extending spine
- Elevated cap stretch: feel right shoulder more
- Capsule stretch: make sure to depress shoulders
- Handstand shoulder extension stretch: need to film myself
- Elevated bridge work: I am going to refrain from this for now

I need to figure out the warmup for the thoracic series.

1x1 side lying shoulder CARs
Gymnastic bodies warmup
1x1:00 farmer carries @16kg
1x10/side BW overhead marches
1x1 slow TGU bodyweight
1x1 slow TGU @ 12kg
1x2m hold: 2:09-0:47
Ladder 1-10 DLR swings
- think just stop here today, because I'm running up on time. And I see now the yanking with the arms.
- Tingling on inside left knee, am I bending too far in?
EMOM 11/min D
1x10 TGU@12kg
[[Side split]] series

Observations:
- tingling on inside left knee during swings is probably because I'm lifting off my left big toe on the downswing. I need to keep it anchored
- For swings, I clearly yank with my arms still a bit, so need to focus on pulling my armpits down to engage the lats to let momentum take control. I don't think I can perfectly place the dumbbell between my legs when fully upright because my arm/torso length is too low, so the bell must come up before I fully extend my hips.
- My breaks are pretty good.
- Almost gave up before EMOMs today, but I'm glad I didn't.
- For the getups, main problems I observe right now is the clicking:

Let me just name all the various positions of the getup.
1. Prone raised: kettlebell in hand, fully extended
2. Laying flexed elbow
3. Seated L with extended elbow
4. Supported lunge
5. L-shaped lunge
6. Lunge
7. Upright

So, transitioning from the Supported Lunge to the Seated L with kettlebell in right hand, my left shoulder pops.


### Saturday
Roll out tibialis
- hip flexors: left hip flexors are much more painful than right 
2x25 dorsiflexion raises against wall
1x25 calf raises against wall
3x5 assisted leg raises to 90 degrees (that machine)--focus on posterior pelvic tilting up
3x5@4kg hip flexor KB raises: a lot easier than last time
5x1 ATG split squats: form getting better

Gracilis stretch

Actually really reduced the tension I feel when trying to side split.

## Plan for week of Monday, Dec 19, 2022
I basically did not do anything this week on account of my illness, minus today's hamstring work and the hanging/shoulder mobility work.
Did do a bit of rucking Friday, Dec 23 2022, though shoulder's were tired before I even got to Bethesda Fountain, plus it was super cold, so I will do more of that tomorrow.
I wonder if I should ruck with the barefoots and just run in bouncy shoes? Honestly, my calves and ankles really take it bad when I run in barefoots.

Anyways, tomorrow, health and time permitting, I will do a kettlebell ladder routine.

My top-level goal is to train for skiing MLK weekend, which will require both cardio and kettlebell conditioning. Plus, need to make sure my boots still work well when I get to dad's on Sunday. 

It's time to lay out some real programming each and every day. Start not too ambitious, then add more work if things seem well. Also track how long each workout takes.

##### Friday
- Rucking, 20lbs with KB, half first leg of loop then back.

##### Saturday
- Rucking, 20lbs, mid loop then back. This time, used the chest buckle, which seemed to distributed the weight better. Went a lot further.

- Side split routine week 2: has its own warmup
- ![[Pasted image 20221224122008.png]]
- For tailor's pose, focus on external rotation of the femur and not pulling the feet in too much to prevent pinching of the TFL


##### Sunday
Workout: I'm... Actually, Ican do this at home later at night, since Equinox closes at 5pm today. At night, after hanging out with Eddy. Otherwise, I'll move this to tomorrow morning.
- Warmup routine: 5m
- Overhead marches: 3x15@8lbs per side: 15m
- 1x3 sideways prone shoulder extension CARS per side: 10m
- 1x1 KB hold for 2m total: 5m
- 1x5 KB DL@24kg, slow and controlled, focusing on lat engagement, armpits squeezing: 10m
- 1x5 rows@unknown: 5m
- Recovery—roll lats and shoulders: 5m


## Plan for week of Monday, Dec 12 2022
- Sunday was legs and press
- Monday is press and mobility: handstand class, maybe the splits stuff? Actually, hamstring stuff.
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCtMzDjL_Bo&ab_channel=StrengthSide
- Tuesday is pull and some legs: single leg squats, ladders, 
- Wednesday is mobility plus pull: Conrad's class, shoulder CARs, scap shrugs
- Thursday is legs again: ladders, EMOMs with getups
- Friday is mobility plus pull: session with Tom, shoulder CARs, scap shrugs
- Saturday is rest, or mobility

**Revised**

- Sunday
	- Noon: Kettlebell class. All-rounded: legs usually, especially glutes and hamstrings, but also some pressing. Just 10 getups, though.
- Monday
	- Morning: Wrist mobility and strength, general pressing strength. Shoulder mobility and strength. Getups.
	- Later: hamstring flexibility.
- Tuesday
	- Lat and scap mobility and strength. Shoulder mobility and strength. Pulling. EMOM at the end.
- Wednesday
	- Leg strength. Single leg squats. Kettlebell swings. Ladders.
	- Side split/front split flexibility. Generally, side split. In the morning, ideally.
- Thursday
	- Afternoon: Wrist mobility and strength, shoulder mobility and strength. general pressing. Getups.
- Friday
	- Afternoon: Lat and scap mobility and strength. Shoulder mobility and strength. Pulling. End with EMOMs.
- Saturday
	- Pure mobility. Side split flexilbiity.

I need a plan for when I miss a day, too.
Every week should be a checklist of those 8 things. Basically, I run down from the top, then repeat the most important things I care about.
- [x] Wrist mobility and strength—general pressing, including getups
- [x] Lat and scap mobility and strength—pulling
- [x] Hamstring/hip flexor flexibility with anterior pelvic tilt plus QL stretching, hip flexor strength
- [x] Side split flexibility
- [ ] Leg strength: glute strength and single leg squat strength, plus ankle mobility
- [ ] EMOMs


### Friday, Dec 16 2022
- breathing supports tension: can add but also take away.
- sharp exhale during swing to be tense at top
- Transverse abdominus
- Toe touch: breathing supported passive stretching can be incorporated 
- Butterfly stretch: staying active from abductors and external rotators, keep feet further from 
- Crawl position: wrist extension,

### Thursday, Dec 15 2022
Since I missed yesterday, which was supposed to be side split plus hamstring, plus some single leg strength, then I should do those today.

Alright, seems the whole side split routine actually takes an hour to an hour and a half, then the hamstring and QL brings it up to 2 hours.

Recovery:
- Rolling hamstrings
- Rolling triceps. Can use the rod to great effect on the upper tricep/shoulder/chest area.


### Wednesday, Dec 14 2022 
Rolled the following:
- Tibialis: improved ankle mobility—squat was much easier
- Front of shoulder plus chest: improved shoulder extension
- Abductors on inside of thighs near knees

Need to do this more.

Starting to think about my goals:
1. Decreasing IT band pain in left knee
2. Wrist mobility and strength, general pressing strength: handstands
3. Lat and scap mobility and strength and engagement
4. Shoulder mobility and strength
5. Hamstring flexibility: ability to touch hands to ground, do front split
6. Side split flexibility: abductors, ATP
7. Cardio and conditioning
8. Leg strength

How am I going to split time across all of these things? I think each day can have a strength and mobility/cardio component.

- Sunday
	- Noon: Kettlebell class. All-rounded: legs usually, especially glutes and hamstrings, but also some pressing. Just 10 getups, though.
- Monday
	- Morning: Wrist mobility and strength, general pressing strength. Shoulder mobility and strength. Getups.
	- Later: hamstring flexibility.
- Tuesday
	- Lat and scap mobility and strength. Shoulder mobility and strength. Pulling. EMOM at the end.
- Wednesday
	- Leg strength. Single leg squats. Kettlebell swings. Ladders.
	- Side split/front split flexibility. Generally, side split. In the morning, ideally.
- Thursday
	- Afternoon: Wrist mobility and strength, shoulder mobility and strength. general pressing. Getups.
- Friday
	- Afternoon: Lat and scap mobility and strength. Shoulder mobility and strength. Pulling. End with EMOMs.
- Saturday
	- Pure mobility. Side split flexilbiity.

I need a plan for when I miss a day, too.

- [ ] Side split flexibility

- [ ] EMOMs

If I miss a class that's supposed to hit something, don't worry, just hit the next thing.
Monday, hit 1. Tuessday, hit lats and scaps. If I miss Wednesday, then just move on to Hamstring/hip flexor flexilibyt and side splits on Thursday. Which is what I'm going to do tomorrow.

With Tom, the things I want to cover are:
1. I'm super bad at pushups, and they haven't gotten much better over time. I have a really weak upper body, and I feel good enough about my lats now that I want this to be my priority.
2. overhead—my ribs are flaring? I feel like I'm arching my back a lot. Also hunching my head. Really should be lifting chest and pulling ribs down. right?
3. For the squat, I notice the butt wink when I go below parallel. Maintaining an upright torso would pusll my center of gravity too far back, hence holding a weight/countertension. Though, it feels a lot is due to my calves being very short. Or if my femur was longer than my calf? I get knee relaxation, but isn't ankle mobility a limiter here, too?

I am severely underestimating recovery. I foam rolled my forward shoulder and upper pec on each side and it made a huge difference to my shoulder mobility. Likewise, foam rolling my adductors and my tibialis muscles made a huge difference to my squat. It was nearly pain free, and my ankle mobility was greatly improved.

### Tuesday, Dec 13 2022
Shoulder mobility and SLS.

Shoulder mobility is getting easier.


### 2022-12-09
Mobility day
- Warmup
- QL stretch routine [[Mobility and Warmup Routines]]
- Hamstring stretch routine
- Side split stretch routine
- Jefferson curls
- Foam roll lats and all that

2022-12-08
- warmup
- Overhead marches: 3x8@6kg per side
- Shoulder cars: 1x3 per side
- Scap shrug holds: 1x5@20s
- Kettlebell holds
- Deadlifts

Pack shoulders while pushing with chest: that's how you extend the arms while maintaining your packed shoulders. 

Scap shrugs: pull straight up instead of back and up. This will really engage the bottom of your scap. Fight for it.

Your shoulder mobility is better now. Can
