### Tuesday
Kettlebell/conditioning day
Morning
What's a runner's warmup? Maybe just the Gymnastic bodies warmup
2 laps around the park
[[Thoracic bridge]] series
- my wrists and elbows can't handle the table. Need to do this gradually
- reverse bear: pretty hard on the wrists
- Supine shoulder extension stretch: definitely can't tough fingertips together, definitely feel it in ulnar side of elbow
- Same with supine shoulder extension rocks
- Seal stretch: definitely feel it in lumbar spine, posterior pelvic tilt causes stretch in abs
- Reach underneaths: I don't get how to do these. Don't feel much of a stretch in the trapezius
- Seal rocks: click in right shoulder when exiting shoulder extension
- Plow pose: definitely need some help resting the legs above head, feel the stretch majorly in the neck and thoracic spine more than the traps
- thoracic band pull: these are hard as fuck. Even without band. Can't roll myself downwards.
- Prone thoracic extension with band: hard as well, hardest part is extending spine
- Elevated cap stretch: feel right shoulder more
- Capsule stretch: make sure to depress shoulders
- Handstand shoulder extension stretch: need to film myself
- Elevated bridge work: I am going to refrain from this for now

I need to figure out the warmup for the thoracic series.

1x10/side BW overhead marches
1x1 slow TGU bodyweight
1x1 slow TGU @ 12kg
1x2m hold: 2:09-0:47
Ladder 1-10 DLR swings
- think just stop here today, because I'm running up on time. And I see now the yanking with the arms.
- Tingling on inside left knee, am I bending too far in?
EMOM 11/min D
1x10 TGU@12kg
[[Side split]] series

Observations:
- tingling on inside left knee during swings is probably because I'm lifting off my left big toe on the downswing. I need to keep it anchored
- For swings, I clearly yank with my arms still a bit, so need to focus on pulling my armpits down to engage the lats to let momentum take control. I don't think I can perfectly place the dumbbell between my legs when fully upright because my arm/torso length is too low, so the bell must come up before I fully extend my hips.
- My breaks are pretty good.
- Almost gave up before EMOMs today, but I'm glad I didn't.
- For the getups, main problems I observe right now is the clicking:

Let me just name all the various positions of the getup.
1. Prone raised: kettlebell in hand, fully extended
2. Laying flexed elbow
3. Seated L with extended elbow
4. Supported lunge
5. L-shaped lunge
6. Lunge
7. Upright

So, transitioning from the Supported Lunge to the Seated L with kettlebell in right hand, my left shoulder pops.


### Saturday
Roll out tibialis
- hip flexors: left hip flexors are much more painful than right 
2x25 dorsiflexion raises against wall
1x25 calf raises against wall
3x5 assisted leg raises to 90 degrees (that machine)--focus on posterior pelvic tilting up
3x5@4kg hip flexor KB raises: a lot easier than last time
5x1 ATG split squats: form getting better

Gracilis stretch

Actually really reduced the tension I feel when trying to side split.
